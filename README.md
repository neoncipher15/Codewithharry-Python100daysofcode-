# 100 Days of Code - Python
This repository documents my journey of learning Python over 100 days, following the comprehensive curriculum provided by CodeWithHarry. The goal is to build a strong foundation in Python programming by completing daily coding challenges, projects, and exercises.

Each day focuses on a new concept or topic, gradually increasing in complexity to help me develop practical skills and deepen my understanding of Python. This consistent practice is aimed at improving problem-solving abilities, coding efficiency, and familiarity with core programming principles.

Whether you are a beginner looking for structured guidance or someone interested in seeing a real-world example of disciplined learning, this repo showcases my progress and notes throughout the 100-day challenge.
